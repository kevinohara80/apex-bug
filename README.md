Community-driven Apex and Visualforce bug/issue tracking

## Overview

This repository is an issues-only repository for submitting reproducable issues with Apex and Visualforce.

## Submission Rules

All issue submissions should be created as an issue in this repository. The following are a set of guidelines to review prior to submitting a new issue.

1. **Only new issues:** Please only submit new issues. If your issue already exists as an issue on the [Known Issues site](https://success.salesforce.com/issues_index), then please do not submit another here.
2. **Provide detail:** Your issue must have clearly-written steps to reproduce and you should strive to provide as much detail as possible.
3. **Include code:** Code examples can be written inline to the issue using [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) or you can provide links to [Gists](https://gist.github.com/), other repos, or even downloads.
4. **Play nice:** This is a community effort to help fix issues and not a forum for venting. Be respectful, helpful, and kind.
5. **Be responsive:** You are responsible for answering questions pertaining to the issues you submit.
6. **Provide updates:** If your issue gets fixed, hits Known Issues, or changes in any other way, please provide updates back to your submitted issue.
