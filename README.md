Community-driven Apex and Visualforce bug/issue tracking

## Overview

This repository is an issues-only repository for submitting reproducable issues with Apex and Visualforce.

## Submission Rules

All issue submissions should be created as an issue in this repository. The following are a set of guidelines to review prior to submitting a new issue.

2. **Only new issues:** Please only submit new issues. If your issue already exists as an issue on the [Known Issues site](https://success.salesforce.com/issues_index), then please do not submit another here.
3. **Provide detail:** Your issue must have (a) **clearly-written steps to reproduce** and (b) **code examples that reproduce the issue**. 
4. **Include code:** Code examples can be written inline to the issue using Markdown or you can provide links to Gists, other repos, or even downloads.
5. **Play nice:** This is a community effort to help fix issues and not a forum for venting. Be respectful.
6. **Be Responsive:** You are responsible for answering questions pertaining to the issues you submit.
