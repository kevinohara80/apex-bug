Community-driven Apex and Visualforce bug/issue tracking

## Overview

This repository is an [issues-only](https://github.com/kevinohara80/apex-bug/issues) repository for submitting new, reproducable issues with Apex and Visualforce. The goal of submitting these issues is to help identify previously unknown issues and get them submitted to the [Known Issues](https://success.salesforce.com/issues_index) site.

## Submission Rules

All issue submissions should be created as an [issue in this repository](https://github.com/kevinohara80/apex-bug/issues). The following are a set of guidelines to review prior to submitting a new issue.

1. **Only new issues:** Please only submit new issues. If your issue already exists as an issue on the [Known Issues](https://success.salesforce.com/issues_index) site, then please do not submit another here. The goal of this project is to bring new issues to light, not reiterate the existing ones.
2. **Provide detail:** Your issue must have clearly-written steps to reproduce and you should strive to provide as much detail as possible.
3. **Include repro code:** Whenever possible, code to reproduce the issue should be submitted. Code examples can be written inline to the issue using [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) or you can provide links to [Gists](https://gist.github.com/), other repos, or even downloads.
4. **Play nice:** This is a community effort to help fix issues and not a forum for venting. Be respectful, helpful, and kind.
5. **Be responsive:** You are responsible for answering questions pertaining to the issues you submit.
6. **Provide updates:** If your issue gets fixed, hits Known Issues, or changes in any other way, please provide updates back to your submitted issue.

## Other Things to Include in your Issue

* API versions affected
